# Google-Task-I4GZuri
hello world!
this task is the first task I'm submitting as a trainee in the I4GxZuri training
it contains the code and styles for creating a non-responsive static Google landing page for dektop

CHALLENGES I ENCOUNTERED
the major challenge i encountered was trying to make this site responsive. it was due to the struggle that I decided to make it non-responsive
plus you know Zuri rules, follow instructions (wink!)
